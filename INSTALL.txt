You can simply move the contents of bin and lib into
the respective directories of /usr/local and things
should work from there. You can also put things into
/usr/depot, then add /usr/depot/bin to your PATH.

You may want to install a perl interpreter.

For a proper integration into your Unix distribution,
reach out for your vendor team.
