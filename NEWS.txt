=== 2016-06-12 === Net::PSYC 1.0 ===

The perlpsyc implementation has proven stable for years.
The development of remotor has shown how powerful,
reliable and easy to use it is. A bump up of the version
to 1.0 was overdue, although the code is unchanged.


=== 2016-06-12 === New tool remoTor ===

Hi there. Here's a fine new little console-based perl script
that lets you control your Tor, monitor circuits as they
happen, issue commands like changing your identity etc, and
forward critical events to a chatroom using the PSYC protocol.

I found vidalia too heavy and arm too confusing and didn't
see a simple tool that would leverage the Tor control protocol
without excessive nuisances, just a bit of noise reduction and
text coloring. Also I like notifications to show in my chat
client.

The notification feature works with a psyced running on the
same host. I just committed a "remotor" chatroom which is
preset to receive messages from the tool, all you need to do
is install psyced and use your IRC client to join #remotor.

For a quick little glimpse into the perl script, click

If anyone is interested, I can easily add the ability to control
the Tor node from the chatroom.
