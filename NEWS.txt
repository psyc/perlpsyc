=== 2016-08-19 === Net::PSYC 1.1 ===

Desktop notifications integrated into psyclisten.

Cookie auth support introduced into remotor.

Clean-ups in psyccmd/psycplay, psycmp3, remotor.

Reorganized or produced in-code documentation of several
tools so that it can be rendered into manual files, web
pages and usage messages.

=== 2016-06-24 === remoTor 1.2 ===

When remoTor is running on the same machine as tor, it can
now also monitor the hostnames the tor process is building
circuits for. You may want to do this if you have devices in
your house that you don't trust, for example. The regular Tor
control protocol doesn't let you have this information other
than by continously polling the stream status, and even then
you may miss out on some short exfiltration going on. remoTor
lets you have this information and even lets you study it
later rather than having to keep your eyes on the control
console all the time.

Also, a person at the remoTor console can now interact with
the people in the chatroom using the built-in chat. No PSYC
software is complete if it isn't also a chat client. You can
also forward the hostname monitoring information to that
chatroom, or simply use a 'psyclisten' if you don't like to
install an entire psyced server. psyclisten is provided with
the perlpsyc library.

remoTor and psycion now have their own web pages generated
out of perldoc:
    http://perlpsyc.cheettyiapsyciew.onion/remotor
    http://perlpsyc.cheettyiapsyciew.onion/psycion

Enhancements and fixes in remotor and psycion.


=== 2016-06-12 === Net::PSYC 1.0 ===

The perlpsyc implementation has proven stable for years.
The development of remotor has shown how powerful,
reliable and easy to use it is. A bump up of the version
to 1.0 was overdue, although the code is unchanged.


=== 2016-06-12 === New tool remoTor ===

Hi there. Here's a fine new little console-based perl script
that lets you control your Tor, monitor circuits as they
happen, issue commands like changing your identity etc, and
forward critical events to a chatroom using the PSYC protocol.

I found vidalia too heavy and arm too confusing and didn't
see a simple tool that would leverage the Tor control protocol
without excessive nuisances, just a bit of noise reduction and
text coloring. Also I like notifications to show in my chat
client.

The notification feature works with a psyced running on the
same host. I just committed a "remotor" chatroom which is
preset to receive messages from the tool, all you need to do
is install psyced and use your IRC client to join #remotor.

For a quick little glimpse into the perl script, click
        http://perl.psyc.eu/navigate/bin/remotor

If anyone is interested, I can easily add the ability to control
the Tor node from the chatroom.
