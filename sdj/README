"Scripting DeeJay"
 ================

   psycmp3 is scriptable by "scripting deejay" files (extension .sdj),
   they allow you to automate operations on mp3 files, yes: even produce
   simple remixes of existing music material. unfortunately rxaudio doesn't
   provide *real* mixing of mp3 files yet..

here are some remixes i made - the mp3 files they use are
not included, just like roms in emulators usually aren't..  ;-)

   for details on the syntax.. guess what.. read the psycmp3 source  ;-)

to be honest.. this is silly stuff nobody needs.. but it was fun!
