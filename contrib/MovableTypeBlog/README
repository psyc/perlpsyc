This MovableType plugin by elridion extends the popular
half-source-ware for blogging by the ability to send
change notifications to arbitrary PSYC uniforms.

You may want to adapt this to other blog and wiki engines.

This plugin was contributed to Net::PSYC by one of its
authors and is licensed under the same conditions as
Net::PSYC itself.
