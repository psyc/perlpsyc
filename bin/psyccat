=head1 NAME

psyccat - a simple tool to send an unnamed file via PSYC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 psyccat [<options>] < <file>
    or
 <command> | psyccat [<options>]
    or
 psyccat [<options>]

 Options:
	-t <uniform>	PSYC address to deliver message to
	-b <uniform>	PSYC address to bind to
	-m <method>	PSYC method to use instead of the default
	-h		Output this usage help message
	-q		Be quiet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Behaves a bit like cat(1). By default it will dump the file
to a psyclisten running on the localhost.

=head1 CAVEATS

As long as Net::PSYC does not provide any encryption, you
should use this within a trustworthy local network or
as a localhost service.
