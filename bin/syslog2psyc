# forwards syslog events to a PSYC target.	-lynX 2006
#
# had i known how easy it is, i would have done this 1997
#
# first set up a pipe where we can get syslog events from:
#	mkfifo /dev/syslog2psyc
#	chown <user> /dev/syslog2psyc
#
# then configure /dev/syslog2psyc as the destination for 
# syslog messages. in syslog-ng.conf it may look like this:
#	destination psyc { pipe("/dev/syslog2psyc"); };
#	log { source(src); destination(psyc); };
#
# in syslog.conf it may look like this:
#	*.warn;*.err			|/dev/syslog2psyc
#
# finally run this script as <user>
# you may later want to refine the type of messages that are
# forwarded to you.
#
# If you don't own an always running PSYC server yet,
# visit http://www.psyced.org. The psyced LPC sandbox
# runtime has a syslog.c ready to use in the place/ folder.
