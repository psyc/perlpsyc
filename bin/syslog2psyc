=head1 NAME

syslog2psyc - a daemon that forwards syslog events to a PSYC entity

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 syslog2psyc <target> [<pipe>]

 <target> is a PSYC uniform to send syslog notices to.
 <pipe> is a non-standard path to the syslog2psyc fifo

=head1 INSTALLATION

First set up a pipe where we can get syslog events from:
	mkfifo /dev/syslog2psyc
	chown <user> /dev/syslog2psyc

Then configure /dev/syslog2psyc as the destination for 
syslog messages. In syslog-ng.conf it may look like this:
	destination psyc { pipe("/dev/syslog2psyc"); };
	log { source(src); destination(psyc); };

In syslog.conf it may look like this:
	*.warn;*.err			|/dev/syslog2psyc

Finally run this script as <user>.
You may later want to refine the type of messages that are
forwarded to you.

If you don't own an always running PSYC server yet,
visit http://www.psyced.org. The psyced LPC sandbox
runtime has a syslog.c ready to use in the place/ folder.
It is reachable at psyc://localhost/\@syslog while your
PSYC client can enter it by means of /subscribe syslog.

=head1 CAVEATS

As long as Net::PSYC does not provide any encryption, you
should use this within a trustworthy local network or
as a localhost service.
