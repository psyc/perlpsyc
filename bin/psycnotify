usage: $0 [-a] [-n <nick>] [-b <uniform>] [<UNI>]+

sends a presence notification to all given UNIs
message defaults to "present", will send "absent" when given the -a flag.

it is correct that psyced doesn't display the "absent" message in most cases,
it will use the information internally, though
