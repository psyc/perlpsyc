perldoc documentation inside the module.
try `perldoc lib/perl5/Net/PSYC.pm` from here.

The commands all provide for usage information when you try to
use them. Just try to.

irssi-psyc, the psyc implementation for irssi, is not provided here.
get it from http://about.psyc.eu/irssi

*) psycmp3 unfortunately depends on a non-free mp3 engine from 1998.
   You may want to await an adaptation to a free framework.

*) remotor is a useful Tor controller with or without PSYC server
