== LIBRARY ==
- provide proper shutdown procedure of all open sockets (+ remove sleep hack)
+ hashing shared secrets between client/server or client/places

== PSYCION ==
- regexp marks
- documentation of possible keys
- MultiScreen with proper scrolling
+ psycion.ebuild (split perlpsyc in several ebuilds?)
  dependencies: dev-perl/IO-Socket-SSL dev-perl/Curses
- a user misunderstood ~/.psyc/me and only put his nickname into it
  psycion should complain
